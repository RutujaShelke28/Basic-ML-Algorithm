# Basic-ML-Algorithm
This file contains a basic machine learning implementation that classifies a fruit as either an apple or an orange based on given input features such as weight, size, or color intensity. The purpose of this implementation is to demonstrate how a simple supervised learning algorithm can be used for binary classification.

The model is trained on a small labeled dataset and learns decision boundaries to distinguish between the two types of fruits. Python and basic machine learning concepts are used to train the model and make predictions.

This file is intended for learning and demonstration purposes, helping beginners understand the working of basic machine learning algorithms and binary classification.
